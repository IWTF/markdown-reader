## ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)

------

### Competition

The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) evaluates algorithms for object detection and image classification at large scale. One high level motivation is to allow researchers to compare progress in detection across a wider variety of objects -- taking advantage of the quite expensive labeling effort. Another motivation is to measure the progress of computer vision for large scale image indexing for retrieval and annotation.

### Workshop
Every year of the challenge there is a corresponding workshop at one of the premier computer vision conferences. The purpose of the workshop is to present the methods and results of the challenge. Challenge participants with the most successful and innovative entries are invited to present. Please visit the corresponding challenge page for workshop schedule and information.

### Download
The most popular challenge is the ILSVRC 2012-2017 image classification and localization task. It is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/overview/description). For all other data please log in or request access.

### Evaluation Server
The evaluation server can be used to evaluate image classification results on the test set of ILSVRC 2012-2017. Please see here for our submission policy. Importantly, you should not make more than 2 submissions per week.

### Updates
- October 10, 2019: The ILSVRC 2012 classification and localization test set has been updated. The Kaggle challenge and our download page both now contain the updated data.
- June 2, 2015: Follow-up update regarding status of the server
- May 19, 2015: Annoucement regarding the submission server
